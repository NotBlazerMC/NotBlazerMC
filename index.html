        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm an alien from andromeda galaxy. My original goal was to destroy Earth but I decided not to. My interests include Game Making, Singing, Playing, Chatting Etc. The things I hate the most are Light Mode, Grass, School, Toxic People, Yafi, Intelligent People and You.
        </p>
      	<p>
          Pro Tip: If you ever see me, Run. If you chose not to, then you will regret it. You don't wanna be near me or else you will become the worst version of yourself. I will be the worst person you ever met. I am the worst person alive ngl. If you disagree to all of this, It's okay, Just know that you're wrong ;)
